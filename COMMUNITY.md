# Engaging in the radare2 community

## Motivation

It has turned out that relying on people's common sense is actually
not sufficient for larger software projects, as there are many
different interpretation of what this means.

So here is a rather vague explanation of what we'd like to see in the
r2 community (eg. GitHub issues, source code, IRC, Telegram, Discord,
conferences)

## What we want to see

We wish to have a supportive community of kind people vibing together,
connected by common interests, which is radare2 and software reverse
engineering in general.

This does not limit the conversations in our discord, telegram, and
IRC-channel to these topics. Of course, you can also talk about other
things **in the side channel**.

We urge you to respect the personal boundaries of each individual in
this community.

## What we don't want to see

We don't want any form of hate or personal attacks in this community.
We understand. that people make mistakes and sometimes don't even
know what they're saying/doing. This is no excuse for intentional
harassment, discriminatory, and abusive behavior.

## What we explicitly tolerate

Mild forms of trolling and non-discriminatory profanity is ok with us.
Interact with each other as you'd interact with a friend, and it will
be fine.

## Rule enforcement?

We do not intend to act as policemen, judges, or legislators, and we
don't want to act as enforcers either. We do not want such roles in
the radare2 community, so we will not officially formulate any strict
rules or penalties.

However, we will take action if necessary.
