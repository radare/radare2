# Radare2 community engagement

## Introduction

Over the years radare2 has grown and grown in terms of source code size,
complexity, features, collaborations, community and in many other ways.

Over time, it has become more and more challenging to manage in a
consistent manner. There exist many different interpretations of problems
and solutions. What might make total sense to one community member,
may not make sense to others. The divergence of opinions and ideas can
be a great thing, allowing for creativity, collaboration and decisive
thinking.

However, this can also bring its own set of challenges, thus the need to
work together to continue to build an evolving tool that the community
love to use and extend.

It's a problem commonly faced by many large software projects and so to
provide guidance to the community, here is a rather simple explanation
of what we'd like to see in the r2 community (eg. GitHub issues, source
code, IRC, Telegram, Discord, conferences)

## What we want to see

We wish to have a supportive community of kind people vibing together,
connected by common interests, which are radare2 and software reverse
engineering in general.

This does not limit the conversations in our discord, telegram, and
IRC-channel to these topics. Of course, you can also talk about other
things **in the side channel**.

We urge you to respect the personal boundaries of everyone in r2land.

## What we don't want to see

We don't want any form of hate or personal attacks in this community.
We understand. that people make mistakes and sometimes don't even
know what they're saying/doing. This is no excuse for intentional
harassment, discriminatory, and abusive behavior.

## What we explicitly tolerate

Mild forms of trolling and non-discriminatory profanity is ok with us.
Interact with each other as you'd interact with a friend, and it will
be fine.

## Rule enforcement?

We do not intend to act as policemen, judges, or legislators, and we
don't want to act as enforcers either. We do not want such roles in
the radare2 community, so we will not officially formulate any strict
rules or penalties.

However, we will take action if necessary.
