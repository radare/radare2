# Engaging in the radare2 community


## Motivation
It has turned out that relying on people's common sense is actually not
sufficient for larger software projects, as there are many different
interpretation of what this means.

So here is a rather vague explaination of what we'd like to see in the r2
community (gh issues, source code, irc, telegram, discord, conferences)

## What we don't want to see
We don't want any form of fascism, racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia,
ableism, antisemitism and xenophobia in this community.
We understand, that people make mistakes, and sometimes don't even know what
they're saying/doing. This is no excuse for intentional harassment,
discriminatory and abusive behaviour.

## What we want to see
We wish to have a supportive community of kind people vibing together,
connected by common interests, which is radare2 and
software reverse engineering in general.

This does not limit the conversations in our
discord, telegram and irc-channel to these topics. Of course,
you can also talk about other things **in the side channel**

We urge you to respect the personal boundaries of
each individual in this community.

## What we explicitly tolerate
Mild forms of trolling and non-discriminatory profanity is ok for us.
Interact with each other as you'd interact with a friend and it will be fine.


## Rule enforcement?
We are neither policemen, judges nor legislators and we don't want to be.
Neither do we want such roles in this community, which is why
we consciously decided to not formulate any strict rules or penalties.
However, we will take action, if necessary.
